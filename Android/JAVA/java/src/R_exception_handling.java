// before Exception handling let's learn about Throwable Class

// Throwable class extends Object class directly
// Throwable class is the superclass of every error and exception

import java.util.Scanner;

// we can create own Throwable class
class  myThrowable extends Throwable{
    myThrowable(){
//        super(); // there in many constructor in Throwable class
//        super("Error");
        super(new ArithmeticException());


        // class inherit many method that we can override

    }
}


//Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved
//Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program

//Type of exception
    // User-Defined
    // Build-In
        // Checked
            //ClassNotFound
            //Interruption
            //SQLException etc.
        // Unchecked
            //ArithmeticException
            //NullPointerException
            //ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc.

// keywords used in Exception handling
    // try: The try block contains a set of statements where an exception can occur.
    // catch: The catch block is used to handle the uncertain condition of a try block. A try block is always followed by a catch block, which handles the exception that occurs in the associated try block.
    // throw: The throw keyword is used to transfer control from the try block to the catch block and it is used to rise the exception
    // throws: The throws keyword is used for exception handling without try & catch block. It specifies the exceptions that a method can throw to the caller and does not handle itself.
    // finally: It is executed after the catch block. We use it to put some common code (to be executed irrespective of whether an exception has occurred or not ) when there are multiple catch blocks.

// we can use nested exception handling
// we can chain the catch block
// we can create custom Exception as well

// Exception handling while overriding

// If The SuperClass doesn’t declare an exception
    // subclass declare checked exception -> gives error
    // SubClass declare Unchecked exception -> no problem
// If The SuperClass declares an exception
    // SubClass declares exceptions other than the child exception of the SuperClass declared Exception -> error
    // SubClass declares a child exception of the SuperClass declared Exception. -> No problem
    // SubClass declares without exception. -> No problem
